# Specification Quality Checklist: Pepper匿名人物識別の完全実装

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning

**Created**: 2026-07-26

**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details beyond mandatory platform and compatibility constraints
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic except mandatory target-platform constraints
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] Implementation choices are deferred to the plan

## Notes

- User explicitly removed observation history, ID merge/split, face/voice linking, and persistent embeddings from scope.
- Android ARM64 validation must precede Pepper API 23/ARMv7 validation.
